Bytes Received (_br)
====================

This is a name/value pair sent with any Telex to indicate to the recipient how many bytes have been received from them at that point.  The value is always a positive integer.

It is a very minimal network diagnostic that is useful to detect packet loss and latency, as well as a way to artificially negatively signal to another Switch.

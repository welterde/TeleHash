Hashmina
========
Hashmina is a Telehash switch and application framework for Java.

Features
========
* Async network programming model with Apache MINA. Similar to node.js, with similar benefits.
* Apache commons and Google Guava to enable some FP-style and generally turn down the suck.

Ideas
=====
* Jackson supports JSON streaming. There's got to be a better way to make use of it...
* OSGi would be a neat platform upon which to build a Telehash application server.

Building
========
Get JDK 1.6, Maven2, do 'mvn compile' in this directory. 'mvn test' to run unit tests.
